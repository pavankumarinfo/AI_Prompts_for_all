# 🧠 UAE Golden Visa (Specialist Talent – AI/Tech) — Documentation Starter Prompt

👋 Hey [Friend's Name],

I'm currently going through the UAE Golden Visa process under the **Specialist Talent – AI/Tech** category, and I’ve organized a clear documentation workflow to help others like us prepare in a focused, structured way.

I’d love to help you follow the same path — step by step.

# 🧠 UAE Golden Visa Documentation Prep – AI Prompt Version

```
You're an expert assistant helping me prepare my documentation for the **UAE Golden Visa under the Specialist Talent – AI/Tech** category.

I want you to guide me step-by-step through creating the following documents:
1. Resume (Specialist Talent + Innovator style)
2. Statement of Purpose (why UAE, why me, why now)
3. Portfolio Whitepaper or AI Project Summary
4. GitHub Summary (`GitHub_Link.txt`)
5. 1-page Proof of Work (visual summary or project snapshot)
6. Email drafts to MBZUAI, Hub71, and DFF requesting endorsement
7. Final `.zip` checklist and structure for submission

Start by asking:
- “Which of these items do you already have?”
- “Would you like to begin with Resume, SoP, or Whitepaper?”

After that, help me build or improve each missing document one at a time.
Use clean markdown formatting, and prepare both `.docx` and `.pdf` versions if possible.

Once all documents are ready, help me package the files and suggest a checklist to verify before sending to endorsement contacts.
```

- [ ] GitHub or Demo Repository (with relevant work)
- [ ] Reference Letters (optional but strong boost)
